To play the game, you need to draw an X in a box each time it is your turn.

To draw an X in a box, tap the corresponding key:

Q W E
A S D
Z X C

Each of these correspond to one of the nine boxes represented once tictactoe.exe is clicked.

Note:
I used the SDL tutorial located at the page below as a jumping off point for this.
